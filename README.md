This is my final project for [Cs50x,introduction to computer science course](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home). 

<p>The project is designed to serve as foodie network in local where admin or users could review any foodie hangout places. The innovative part of the project would be we could check the trending foods based on charisma, promotion places, and food issues all together in one place. The project is still in development phase.
